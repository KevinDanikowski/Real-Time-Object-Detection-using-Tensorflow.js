# Real-Time-Object-Detection-using-Tensorflow.js

## Detecting Objects
To make object detection predictions, all we need to do is import the TensorFlow model, coco-ssd, which can be installed with a package manager like NPM or simply imported in a <script> tag. We can then load the model, and make a prediction.
  
  
  * **Note: Loading the model can take several seconds. It is best to load the model once and save a reference to it.** 
  
## Dependencies:

* [Tensorflow Models: Coco SSD](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd) - Object detection model that aims to localize and identify multiple objects in a single image.
* [Tensorflow.js]https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs) - TensorFlow.js is an open-source hardware-accelerated JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models.
* [React] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) - React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.
* [React DOM] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) - This package serves as the entry point to the DOM and server renderers for React. It is intended to be paired with the generic React package, which is shipped as react to npm.
* [React Scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) - This package includes scripts and configuration used by Create React App.
