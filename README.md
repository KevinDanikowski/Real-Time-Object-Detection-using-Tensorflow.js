## Detecting Objects
To make object detection predictions, all we need to do is import the TensorFlow model, coco-ssd, which can be installed with a package manager like NPM or simply imported in a <script> tag. We can then load the model, and make a prediction.
  
  
  * **Note: Loading the model can take several seconds. It is best to load the model once and save a reference to it.**
